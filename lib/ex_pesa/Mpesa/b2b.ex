defmodule ExPesa.Mpesa.B2B do
  @moduledoc """
  This API enables Business to Business (B2B) transactions between a business and another business.
  Use of this API requires a valid and verified B2B M-Pesa short code for the business initiating the transaction and the both businesses involved in the transaction.

  @doc """
  Initiates the Mpesa B2B .

  ## Configuration
  Add below config to dev.exs / prod.exs files
  This asumes you have a clear understanding of how Daraja API works. See docs here https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/docs#b2b-api

  #### B2B - Configuration Parameters
  - `initiator` - This is the credential/username used to authenticate the transaction request.
    Environment
    - production
      - create a user with api access method (access channel)
      - Enter user name
      - assign business manager role and B2B ORG API initiator role.
    Use the username from your notifitation channel (SMS)
    - sandbox - use your own custom username.

  - `timeout_url` - The path that stores information of time out transactions.it should be properly validated to make sure that it contains the port, URI and domain name or publicly available IP.
  - `result_url` - The path that receives results from M-Pesa it should be properly validated to make sure that it contains the port, URI and domain name or publicly available IP.
  - `security credential` - To generate security_credential, head over to https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/test_credentials, then Initiator Security Password for your environment.

    `config.exs`
    ```elixir
      config :ex_pesa,
          mpesa: [
              b2b: [
                short_code: "",
                initiator_name: "",
                timeout_url: "",
                result_url: "",
                security_credential: "<credential here>"
              ]
          ]
    ```

  Alternatively, generate security credential using certificate
    `cert` - This is the M-Pesa public key certificate used to encrypt your plain password.
    There are 2 types of certificates.
      - sandox - https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/sites/default/files/cert/cert_sandbox/cert.cer .
      - production - https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/sites/default/files/cert/cert_prod/cert.cer .
    `password` - This is a plain unencrypted password.
    Environment
      - production - set password from the organization portal.
      - sandbox - use your own custom password

    `config.exs`
    ```elixir
      config :ex_pesa,
          mpesa: [
              cert: "<certificate content>"
              b2b: [
                short_code: "",
                initiator_name: "",
                password: "<your password>",
                timeout_url: "",
                result_url: ""
              ]
          ]
    ```

  ## Parameters

  attrs: - a map containing:
  - `command_id` - Unique command for each transaction type, possible values are: BusinessPayBill, MerchantToMerchantTransfer, MerchantTransferFromMerchantToWorking, MerchantServicesMMFAccountTransfer, AgencyFloatAdvance.
  - `amount` - The amount being transacted.
  - `receiver_party` - Organizationâ€™s short code receiving the funds being transacted.
  - `remarks` - Comments that are sent along with the transaction.
  - `account_reference` - Account Reference mandatory for "BusinessPaybill" CommandID.

  ## Example
      iex> ExPesa.Mpesa.B2B.request(%{command_id: "BusinessPayBill", amount: 10500, receiver_party: 600000, remarks: "B2B Request", account_reference: "BILL PAYMENT"})
